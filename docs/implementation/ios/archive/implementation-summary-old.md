# Radar iOS Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This plan transforms the placeholder React Native app into a native SwiftUI iOS application that mirrors the Radar web app while leveraging iOS-specific features and design patterns.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Project Structure**
- Xcode project lives OUTSIDE the turborepo at `radar-apple/`
- Follows your convention: `<projectName>/<projectName>-apple`
- Clean separation between iOS and web codebases
- Shared concepts through API contracts, not code

### 2. **Native SwiftUI over React Native**
- Superior performance with no JavaScript bridge
- Access to latest iOS features and APIs
- Better animations and gesture handling
- Smaller app size and faster startup
- Easier maintenance with single language

### 3. **Package-Based Architecture**
Inspired by your reference apps (Margins, Kumori):
- `Design` - Reusable UI components and theme
- `RadarAuth` - Clerk integration with biometrics
- `RadarAPI` - Networking and caching layer
- `RadarCore` - Shared models and business logic

## Implementation Phases

- Main radar list with native patterns
- Creation flow with animations
- Swipe actions and gestures
- Pull-to-refresh

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Days 14-17)
**Agents 5-7: Polish & Native Features**
- Opinion cards with animations

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear path to creating a world-class native iOS app for Radar. By following the modular architecture from your reference apps and leveraging SwiftUI's capabilities, we'll deliver an app that feels truly native while maintaining feature parity with the web version.

The estimated 15-20 day timeline allows for proper implementation, testing, and polish. Each agent has clear responsibilities and deliverables, ensuring smooth parallel development when possible.
